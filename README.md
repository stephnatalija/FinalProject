# FinalProject
The executable code, and powerpoint for my final project: Journal Logger

This is a journal logger, an application that gives users a space to keep track of their ideas, goals, or a space to vent. It also tracks how many journals you create and the average word count. Created with Apache NetBeans and Swing. For this project I created it entirely using Java. 

How to Use:
1. User will open up the application, select a journal type
2. The user will then add their text to the box and hit submit
3. Once the user hits submit the date/time as well as the journal type will be added to the title
4. The journal entry will end up in the journal entries folder
5. Also when the user submits their entry, it will automatically be added to the average journal length tracker and post count traker
     a. if the user is intersted to see their average word count or how many entries they made:
         i. the user will simply choose either option (average journal length tracker or post count tracker) then click calculate
6. the application will not close unless the user specifially exits out of it
