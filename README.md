# FinalProject
The executable code, and powerpoint for my final project: Journal Logger

This is a journal logger, an application that gives users a space to keep track of their ideas, goals, or a space to vent. It also tracks how many journals you create and the average word count. Created with Apache NetBeans and Swing. For this project I created it entirely using Java.
